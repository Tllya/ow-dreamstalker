# Escape the Dreamstalker

Ohhh ahhh oh no theres a DREAMSTALKER after u!

TODO:

- Add spawn points to each planet near a campfire. 
- Add debug commands to respawn at each planet
- Add a Dreamstalker to each planet (or the same one and just change what planet its set to?)
- Add oxygen to all planets
- When dying, only restart that planet
- Create difficulty options affecting:
  - Speed
  - Teleport range
  - Kill radius
  - Respawn point

Planets:
- Timber Hearth:
  - Spawn at default spawn point
  - Go to the observatory. The state will stare at you and you will wake up at the next location.
- Brittle Hollow:
  - Spawn at Riebeck's camp?
  - Black hole should kill you
  - Go idk where
- Hourglass Twins
  - Start on Ash Twin. Teleport to Ember Twin
  - Have to light a fire on each one
  - Probably travel to the bottom of that one big gorge.
- Giant's Deep
  - Spawn on Gabbro's island. 
  - Talk to Quantum mix of all travelers
  - Have the Dreamstalker just watch you all quantum-y
  - Sleep at the campfire to progress
- Dream World
  - Sort of like Wetrock but with more huts
  - Fill it up with corpses
  - You have to die to wake up, but not from it killing you?
- Quantum Moon
  - Light a fire on each aspect. Each one you light switches you to the next aspect
  - On the 6th location aspect you see the Dreamstalker where Solanum was. Then you blink and she switches back.
  - You talk to her about some Eye stuff idk
  - You blink and you're in that big galaxy forest from the end of the game
  - You're around the fire with the characters and each time you blink there's a different combination of people
  - Get grabbed by Dreamstalker from behind but play the candle blow out animation and just cut to credits?

Eat a marshmallow roasted at a green fire to wake up on Dark Bramble with Ernesto, then you get teleported back after talking to him

Order could be TH->BH->GD->HT->DW->QM
