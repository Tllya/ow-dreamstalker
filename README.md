# Escape the Dreamstalker

Ohhh ahhh oh no theres a DREAMSTALKER after u!

Brittle Hollow fix: sucks when you jump down to the black hole from the quantum tower and accidentally die hitting the bottom of it if you mess up. Maybe like, remove its collision? have you bounce off? just do the warp before then?

Brittle Hollow:
  - Fix sector loading issues for observatory and remove those props manually OR just spawn outside by the ship

Dreamworld:
  - Use the elevator in the lodge to go to the Dreamworld

Quantum moon:
  - Talk to Solanum about some Eye stuff idk

Ancient Glade:
  - You blink and you're in that big galaxy forest from the end of the game
  - You're around the fire with the characters and each time you blink there's a different combination of people
  - Get grabbed by Dreamstalker from behind but play the candle blow out animation and just cut to credits? spooky epic scary?
