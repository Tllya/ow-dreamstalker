# Escape the Dreamstalker

Ohhh ahhh oh no theres a DREAMSTALKER after u!

TODO:

- Add spawn points to each planet near a campfire. 
- Add debug commands to respawn at each planet DONE
- Add a Dreamstalker to each planet (or the same one and just change what planet its set to?) DONE
- Add oxygen to all planets DONE
- When dying, only restart that planet
- Create difficulty options affecting:
  - Speed
  - Teleport range
  - Kill radius
  - Respawn point

Brittle Hollow fix: sucks when you jump down to the black hole from the quantum tower and accidentally die hitting the bottom of it if you mess up. Maybe like, remove its collision? have you bounce off? just do the warp before then?

Planet ideas:
- Timber Hearth:
  - Spawn at default spawn point DONE
  - Go to the observatory. The statue will stare at you and you will wake up at the next location. (Got lazy and just if u go to observatory u win) DONE
- Brittle Hollow:
  - Spawn in observatory
  - Jump in black hole
- Hourglass Twins
  - Start on Ash Twin. Teleport to Ember Twin
  - Have to light a fire on each one
  - Probably travel to the bottom of that one big gorge.
  got lazy you just do ember twin and go to escape pod DONE
- Giant's Deep
  - Spawn on Gabbro's island. 
  - Talk to Quantum mix of all travelers
  - Have the Dreamstalker just watch you all quantum-y
  - Sleep at the campfire to progress
- Dream World
  - Sort of like Wetrock but with more huts
  - Fill it up with corpses
  - You have to die to wake up, but not from it killing you? idk
- Quantum Moon
  - Light a fire on each aspect. Each one you light switches you to the next aspect
  - On the 6th location aspect you see the Dreamstalker where Solanum was. Then you blink and she switches back.
  - You talk to her about some Eye stuff idk
  - You blink and you're in that big galaxy forest from the end of the game
  - You're around the fire with the characters and each time you blink there's a different combination of people
  - Get grabbed by Dreamstalker from behind but play the candle blow out animation and just cut to credits? spooky epic scary?

Eat a marshmallow roasted at a green fire to wake up on Dark Bramble with Ernesto, then you get teleported back after talking to him

Order could be TH->BH->GD->HT->DW->QM
